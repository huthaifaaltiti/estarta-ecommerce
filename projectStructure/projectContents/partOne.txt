- Redux Thunk: it's a middleware of our redux process, that allows us to dispatch an action not an object.

  - Function that returns a function:

    function funcName () {
      return (dispatch) => {
        ....
       }
     }

    - or we can re-write the upper function in another way called (carrying):
      
      const funcName = () => (dispatch) => {
        ....
      }

    - This funcName () is called action creator, and it's role is just to return an action insid a function.

- Redux-Thunk benefits: 

  - Dispatch has an async behavior.

  - More readable.

- We have to put every project feature in a gitHub branch them merge it.

- If project is built by Vite, any component returns a JSX so the file extension should be (.jsx).

- To build the store:

  1 - Build a redux folder => store.js => import store inside index.js => create AllReducers.js inside redux folder and then pass it to store.

    - we have to "think" about our project path, so here in this project we need a reducer for products, user, and for cart. => build a folder inside redux folder for each one of reducers => build a constants.js file inside products folder (each reducer will have three .js files: constants, reducer, and actions), we can have a benefit of this constants file to edit in one place.

- react-router-dom inside the app.js
