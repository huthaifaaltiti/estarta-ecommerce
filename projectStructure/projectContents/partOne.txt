- Redux Thunk: it's a middleware of our redux process, that allows us to dispatch an action not an object.

  - Function that returns a function:

    function funcName () {
      return (dispatch) => {
        ....
       }
     }

    - or we can re-write the upper function in another way called (carrying):
      
      const funcName = () => (dispatch) => {
        ....
      }

    - This funcName () is called action creator, and it's role is just to return an action insid a function.

- Redux-Thunk benefits: 

  - Dispatch has an async behavior.

  - More readable.
